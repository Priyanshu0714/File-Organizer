# 📂 File Organizer

This **File Organizer** was a part of my basics as I was on the journey to learn **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
It organizes files in a specified folder based on their extensions, creating separate directories for file types like **JPEG, PDF, PNG, ZIP**, etc.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatically scans a folder (`/test-files`) for files  
- Sorts files into folders based on their extensions  
- Supports **JPEG, PDF, PNG, ZIP** file types  
- Uses **Node.js (fs, path, express)** for file handling  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **fs-extra**
- **path module**

## ⚡ How to Use
